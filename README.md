# Automated-LC-Data-Extraction-and-Analysis
The `lcsOldActual()` function is labeled "Extracting data from API - LCS Old Actual". It operates within a Google Sheets environment to fetch and process data from the AIESEC analytics API. Initially, it retrieves data from the "Base actuals term 22_LC" sheet, focusing on a specific column (6th column). It iterates over an array of `sprintOldStartDate` values to construct API URLs and fetch JSON data. For each URL, it parses the JSON response and extracts specific data points corresponding to AIESEC operations metrics. These metrics are organized into arrays and then written back into the spreadsheet starting from specific row indices (`rowStartIndex[i]`) and iterating through 12 rows. This process effectively automates the retrieval and storage of AIESEC performance data from the API directly into the spreadsheet, facilitating ongoing analytics and reporting tasks within AIESEC's operational framework.
